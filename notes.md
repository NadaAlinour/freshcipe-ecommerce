- accessibility stuff:
Instructions must also be provided to define the meaning of the symbols or text. (e.g. required form fields are marked by asterisk " * ") 

- clicking logout from the navbar redirects to login page/ homepage (idk) if user was in account page, otherwise no need to redirect anywhere.

- maybe add a back "link" (maybe it's actually a link idk) but not on the homepage in the navbar
